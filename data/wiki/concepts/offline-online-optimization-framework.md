# Offline-Online Optimization Framework

Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) require UAV communication systems to adapt to large-scale propagation changes and fast local channel fluctuations. This framework addresses the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, fluid antenna (FA) positions, and beamforming under mobility, energy, hardware, and security constraints by separating long-term prior information processing from real-time adaptive control.

## 개요
Fluid antennas (FAs) provide an additional degree of freedom by reconfiguring antenna positions within a compact aperture. The framework adopts a **dual-mobility perspective**: UAV trajectory planning provides macro-mobility for large-scale air-to-ground geometry adaptation, while FA position reconfiguration provides micro-mobility for fine-grained local channel adaptation. The joint optimization of UAV trajectory, FA positions, and beamforming presents high computational complexity and information uncertainty. To address this, the framework separates the optimization process into two stages:
- **Offline stage**: Utilizes prior information such as environment maps, user mobility patterns, and statistical channel state information (CSI) for long-term optimization.
- **Online stage**: Performs real-time adaptation using instantaneous CSI to handle fast local channel fluctuations.

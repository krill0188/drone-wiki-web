# MAVShield: MAVLink Security Cipher

ArXiv paper (2025-04-29) presenting MAVShield, a lightweight cipher for securing MAVLink communications in UAVs.

## Problem

MAVLink protocol transmits unencrypted messages between UAVs and Ground Control Stations by default, making it vulnerable to attacks.

## MAVShield

Novel lightweight cipher designed specifically for MAVLink security in UAVs.

## Comparison

Implemented and evaluated alongside:
- AES-CTR
- ChaCha20
- Speck-CTR
- Rabbit

## Security Analysis

- Statistical test suites: NIST and Diehard
- Strong resistance to cryptanalysis demonstrated

## Performance Evaluation

**Metrics:**
- Memory usage
- CPU load
- Battery power consumption

**Results:** MAVShield outperforms existing algorithms across all metrics.

## Validation

Real drone testbed evaluation (not just theoretical/simulation-based).

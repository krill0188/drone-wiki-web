# RMWorld: Task-Aware Radio World Models

ArXiv paper (2026-08-20) presenting RMWorld, a task-aware radio world model framework for multi-UAV communication control.

## Problem

Reliable multi-UAV communication requires predicting aerial links before measurements are available. Radio world models have non-uniform errors — globally accurate models may fail along high-demand corridors or association boundaries.

## RMWorld Framework

Couples two key components:
1. **Value-of-information channel calibration**
2. **Credibility-diversity multi-trial selection**

## Technical Approach

- Biased propagation formula corrected by Bayesian residual
- Link valued by exact one-label reduction in locally linearized task-integrated posterior rate variance
- Counterfactual branches selected by task-gated log-determinant objective
- Conflict projection and fixed-batch validation

## Theoretical Results

- Variance-reduction identity derived
- Posterior task-risk equivalence proven
- Submodular greedy guarantee established
- Scoped first-order non-interference result

## Performance

- **3GPP trials**: 0.949 bit/s/Hz task-weighted RMSE
- **DeepMIMO trials**: 0.967 median backlog reduction vs Ensemble UCB at 37.5% more offline rollouts

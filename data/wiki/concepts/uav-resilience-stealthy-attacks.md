# UAV Resilience Against Stealthy Attacks

ArXiv paper (2025-03-21) presenting an architecture for securing UAV software stacks against attackers who compromise GCS or UAV software.

## Problem

UAVs depend on untrusted software components, making them targets for attacks. Existing work addresses either GCS compromise OR UAV software compromise, but not both simultaneously.

## Solution

Architecture with:
- Runtime monitoring
- seL4-based software isolation

## Capabilities

- Prevents attackers from exploiting software bugs
- Prevents stealthy attacks
- Retrofits legacy UAVs
- Secures MAVLink protocol

## Benefits

- Wide adoption possible through MAVLink compatibility
- Protection against both GCS and UAV-side attacks
- Formal verification through seL4 isolation

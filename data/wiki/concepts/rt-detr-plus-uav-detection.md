# RT-DETR++ for UAV Object Detection

ArXiv paper (2025-09-11) introducing RT-DETR++ with enhanced encoder for UAV imagery object detection.

## Challenges in UAV Object Detection

- Densely packed small objects
- Scale variations
- Occlusion

## Key Improvements

### Channel-Gated Attention-based Upsampling/Downsampling (AU/AD)

- Dual-path system minimizing errors
- Preserves details during feature layer propagation

### CSP-PAC Feature Fusion

- Parallel hollow convolutions processing local and contextual information
- Facilitates multi-scale feature integration within the same layer

## Performance

- Superior detection of small and densely packed objects
- Maintains real-time detection speed
- No increase in computational complexity

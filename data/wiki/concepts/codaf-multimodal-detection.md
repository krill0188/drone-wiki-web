# CoDAF: Cross-modal Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion

CoDAF is a unified framework for weakly aligned UAV-based object detection that jointly addresses spatial misalignment between RGB and infrared imagery through offset-guided semantic alignment and dynamic attention-guided fusion.

## Problem Statement

UAV platform motion and asynchronous imaging cause spatial misalignment between visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities, leading to:
- Semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations
- Modality conflict during feature fusion

## Architecture

### Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA)
- Estimates attention-based spatial offsets
- Uses deformable convolution guided by shared semantic space
- Precisely aligns features across modalities

### Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM)
- Adaptively balances modality contributions through gating
- Refines fused features via spatial-channel dual attention
- Integrates alignment and fusion in unified design

## Performance

- **Dataset**: DroneVehicle
- **mAP**: 78.6%
- Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods

## Applications

- Environmental monitoring
- Urban security
- Aerial surveillance

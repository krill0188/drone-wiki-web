# WAVE-DETR: Multi-Modal Drone Detector

ArXiv paper (2025-09-11) introducing WAVE-DETR, combining visible RGB and acoustic signals for robust real-life UAV detection.

## Approach

Fuses visual and acoustic features in a unified object detector using:
- Deformable DETR architecture
- Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings

## Datasets

- Drone-vs-Bird dataset (existing)
- ARDrone dataset (new, 7,500+ synchronized images and audio segments)

## Fusion Configurations

Four fusion approaches tested:
1. Gated mechanism (best performer)
2. Linear layer
3. MLP
4. Cross attention

## Results

**Gated fusion improvements over Deformable DETR baseline:**
- Small drones: +11.1% to +15.3% mAP (IoU 0.5-0.9)
- Medium and large drones: Enhanced mAP scores
- Overall gains: +3.27% to +5.84% across all drone sizes

## Architecture

- Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings fused with multi-resolution feature mappings from Deformable DETR
- Enhances object detection across all drone dimensions
